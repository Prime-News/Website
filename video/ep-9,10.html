<h3 class="hr-margin-video">In the first ever episode of Malvern Prime News we interviewed; Steph Spencer. She is a remarkaable scientist who came to Malvern Primary School to teach us about science. Everyones all loves here coming because of how clear and fun she makes it but all the experiments. We had Jupuru come in to teach us about reconciliation week and he was just so funny with all his jokes and tricks but mainly his music. We couldn't beleive what happened next Kattie Allen the Fedral Member for Higgins came to Malvern Primary to help the year six's open parliment.</h3><br>
